# auroraprotect-tenant-stats
Python GUI to allow selecting tenants via Arctic Wolf Aurora Tenant API and retrieve stats.

First create the proper APP Secret and APP ID in your Aurora Protect console.
In the file named tenants.json, change the settings for each of the tenants you intend to connect to with the appropriate corresponding APP Secret, APP ID and Tenant ID. Change "Tenant1", for example, to the name of the customer tenant you are wanting to see from the dropdown when the script is run.

Run the script and select the Tenant from the drop down. Select Connect and then you can run the other commands such as retrieving threats, devices, users and detections.
